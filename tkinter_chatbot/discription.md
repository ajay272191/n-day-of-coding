# pyttsx3
```
pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3
```
# Tokenization:
```
	This is the process by which big quantity of text is divided into smaller parts called tokens.
	Natural language processing is used for building applications such as Text classification,
	intelligent chatbot, sentimental analysis, language translation, etc.
```
# Punkt:
```
	This is tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences by using an unsupervised algorithm
	to build a model for abbreviation words, collocations, and words that start sentences.
	It must be trained on a large collection of plaintext in the target language before it can be used.
```

# Synset:
```
	This is a special kind of a simple interface that is present in NLTK to look up words in WordNet.
	Synset instances are the groupings of synonymous words that express the same concept.
```

# WordNet:
```
	This is a lexical database of semantic relations between words in more than 200 languages.
	WordNet links words into semantic relations including synonyms, hyponyms, and meronyms.
	The synonyms are grouped into synsets with short definitions and usage examples.
```
# TfidVectorizer
```
	TfidVectorizer used for feature extraction i.e. for our case we use it to check the frequency of the term which is occur more in answer as well as users query and based on cosine_similarity it predict the best answer.
